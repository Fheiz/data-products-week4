## Description

The Shiny Application displays alcohol consumption:

- for all the country in the world
- by beverage type

for the years 2000 to 2015.

The data are accesible to the following [link](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.52160).

## Dataset content

Here are 10 lines of the file:

```{r head-10-lines, echo=FALSE}
data = read.csv("../shiny/data/better_beer_consumption.csv", sep=",", header=T)
data[1310:1320, ]
```


## Lessons learned

- Necessary to use reactive function as soon as we have 2 inputs or more.
- Usage of uiOutput in the ui and renderUI in the server


## Conclusion

- I feel more confortable with R
- Shiny allow us to create quickly nice application
- Python can be a good help in order to process the data
